BOOCCHI'S  SITE


![[Pasted image 20250108223407.png]]



- In this challenge we were given a site with a description that the site has some hidden info in it so i visited the site and found a static site written in html and css and there were only some tabs in the website based on some anime characters
- As it was mentioned in the description i searched for some hidden content in the website source code to see if i can find something in it 
- And i found something odd from the other contents of the html page which was not displayed in the website
